                You're sick and tired of reading betting stories that seem
                unrealistic, and you're just looking for a way to earn a
                modest annual income by betting from home; then listen
                carefully for the next 5 minutes, as I explain precisely how I
                managed to become a full-time punter without some miracle

                The horse betting business is a place where you learn how to
                risk money to make money, in a practical and healthy way…
                However in this business there are a lot of losers that don’t
                respect the craft, and just gamble.

                you care about his Highness’ political ambition. And you don’t

                You want a passive income that can supplement what you already
                have. A steady but growing bank that can cover that debt or
                get you to that holiday resort in Tenerife.
                <br /><br />
                So far, you have wasted your time online and nothing has
                worked.
                <br /><br />
                You have scoured through tedious systems and gone back and
                forth with the overpromising tipsters just to end up with less
                in your bank account than when you started.
                <br /><br />
                I’d like to present you with a slightly different approach

            <li>Betting on jumps</li>

          <p>
            I knew that there were people out there reaping the rewards of
            betting but they were definitely not going about it the way did.
            <br />
            <br />
            All these sales pages with smiley tipsters didn’t feel like the real
            deal.

          <p>
            So like everyone else, I joined forums and made contacts with other
            punters and industry heads who were all on that never ending quest
            to betting riches.
            <br />
            <br />
            By the way, if you haven’t done this yet, I advise you to sign up to
            OLBG or Punters Lounge as there are people on there with decades of
            experience that might be able to give you that missing piece of your
            puzzle.

            <br />
            I came across a guy on a thread who worked for an Israeli bookmaker.
            <br />
            <br />
            I’d love to tell you which one but I’d be breaching their terms and
            conditions which could get my site shut down so Imma leave that out
            for now.
            <br />
            <br />
            We became quite close and I started Skyping him every now and again
            to ask those aggravating question like:
            <span class="italicBold">Who is creating those odds that bookmakers publish?</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span class="italicBold">
              Why do odds drop or rise so quickly? And which market is best to
              bet on?</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            He seemed to be quite open and he always answered me fairly which
            was surprising.
            <br />
            <br />
            Until now, I think its because we both were family men. Although we
            had no business talking to each other, it always broke the ice.
            <br />
            <br />
            The purpose of everything we did was to improve the lives of our
            family, and it remains the same today.

            <span>We all had setbacks (I’m no exception), but you have to learn how
              to bounce back and make a better person of yourself!</span>
            <br /><br />
            There was a time when I was the most risky bettor!

            And we have all been there (or maybe you’re still there):

            <br /><br />
            Trying to turn £50 into £150 on the same day.
            <br /><br />
            No real understanding of bank management.
            <br /><br />
            More Often Than Not, My £50 Investment Would Go Up To £150 Monday -
            Only To Hit £0.00 By Wednesday Tea Time!
            <br /><br />
            My assumption was that if I won just one 10/1 a week with an average
            of 10 bets a week, I would break even.
            <br /><br />
            So my logic meant 2 winning days per week would suffice to get solid
            profits.
            <br /><br />
            And with the advent of machine learning in the late 2010’s I felt
            like I could make this idea a reality.
            <br /><br />
            Here was my ill-advised approach:
            <br /><br />
            <span>I combined three of my best-performing horse racing systems, and
              fused it into one finite method.</span>
            <br /><br />
            My logic didn’t work..
            <br /><br />
            In a short time I was nearly £1,200 down and scratching my head?!
            <br /><br />
            All 3 of the systems had made us a little money for at least 6
            months, and had come from 3 very different sources and styles of
            betting.
            <br /><br />
            However all that glitters is not gold. They soon saw a downtrend.

          I took the initiative to contact an expert in the field of my

          It was an old mate who studied Finance and had based his

          His hypothesis was that the maximum betting profit is derived from

          see.

          So that faithful summer in August 2020 we made the key decision that
          changed everything
          <br /><br />
          We threw away all of my systems and kept only the most consistent
          one.
          <br /><br />
          After finishing my day job as a security guard, we would spend 4-5
          hours analyzing horse racing data in the most in-depth and advanced
          way possible.
          <br /><br />
          We were scraping through:
        </p>

        <ul class="scrapingList">
          <li>Live text commentaries</li>
          <li>Deep historical data</li>
          <li>Cumulative stats</li>
          <li>Horse racing results</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Instead of taking other people's betting systems and using that as a
          foundation, I was going to the source and doing it myself.
          <br /><br />
          Andrew Beyer, Ken Ostermann, and Richard Eng were a few of the horse
          racing authors who educated me get through this period
        </p>

        <p class="weekText">
          On week 1 we hit 2 different 10/1 winners and 5 losses. That’s 15pts
          profit!
          <br /><br />
          In place of trying to pick a horse based on narrow criteria, we
          could simply use the software to finely comb through data and find
          that needle in the haystack
          <br /><br />
          After this switch, I experienced the biggest upswing in any of our
          betting careers.
          <br /><br />
          A stunning X winners in just 17 days left us (and most certainly my
          wife) gobsmacked!

        <p>
          Rather than following trends, constantly buying systems and seeing
          what is happening on all forums we were just doing our own thing.
          <br /><br />
          And yes, it is time consuming! <br />
          At times, I can spend up to 60+ hours a week! <br /><br />
          But I am loving it.

                    <br /><br />
                    I’m now a small-time real estate investor and wake up
                    every day with a huge smile on my face.
                    <br /><br />
                    I also fully left my job as a plumber and am helping my
                    local betting community with classes in my spare time.

                      But there is one thing I’d like you to remember whilst
                      you’re watching this video.
                      <br /><br />
                      As mentioned above, the majority of selections are
                      placed on uncommon teams so if too follow the software’s
                      selections it could hugely negatively the odds.
                      <br /><br />
                      This would ultimately defeat the purpose of the
                      software. Because of this, Ling has limited the amount
                      of new licenses to 150 in order to preserve our
                      profitability.
                      <br /><br />
                      63 of these have already been preserved for friends and
                      family which leaves us with 87 licenses. They will be
                      gone by the end of the day so scoop up your spot before
                      you seriously miss out on an unique opportunity.

                For those of you are still sceptical about the software. Have your time to think… but know this; when
                this software reaches the maximum amount of clients, I won’t be able to accept any more users.

              The bot is linked with a few betting companies, which we cannot name due to prying eyes, however, the
              software does not breach any laws & regulations within your region. … we advise members to keep secrecy as
              we do not want the bookies to involve themselves in our business as they will try come up with a
              contingency plan for our software… So I advice punters to bet reasonably and carefully.second income to
